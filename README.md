This project presents a Food Ordering Chatbot developed using the MERN stack—MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. This chatbot enhances user experience in the food service industry by automating the ordering process through a 
conversational interface integrated with a dynamic backend. It features realtime messaging, order tracking, and personalized interactions through cookie management. The frontend uses React for an intuitive chat interface, while the backend, with Node.js and 
Express.js, manages API interactions and database 
communications. The system’s AI component intelligently processes queries, simulating reallife interactions. Future enhancements include advanced machine learning to improve personalization and 
efficiency. This project demonstrates the application of fullstack development and AI in improving customer 
service and operational efficiency.
